/*
* Implement a class named Building:

* Constructor attributes:
*        sqft (Number)
* Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version

* Implement a getter for each attribute.
* Consider this class as an abstract class.
*   And make sure that any class that extends from it should implement
*   a method named evacuationWarningMessage.
* If a class that extends from it does not have a
* evacuationWarningMessage method, throw an error with the message Class
